Animesh has N empty candy jars, numbered from 1 to N, with infinite capacity. He performs M operations. Each operation is described by 3 integers a, b and k. Here, a and b are index of the jars, and k is the number of candies to be added inside each jar whose index lies between a and b (both inclusive). Can you tell the average number of candies after M operations?
